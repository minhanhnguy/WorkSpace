    \item Find two numbers whose difference is 100 and whose product is a minimum.\\
    Let calls that two numbers x and y.
    \[x + y = 100\]
    \[y = 100 - x\]
    Product is a minimum:
    \[P = xy\]
    \[P = x(100-x)\]
    \[P = 100x - x^2\]
    \[P' = 100 - 2x = 0\]
    \[x = 50\]
    Since x = 50:
    \[y = 50\]
    Hence, these two numbers are both 50.
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item What is the maximum vertical distance between the line \(y=x+2\) and the parabola \(y=x^2\) for $-1 \leq x \leq 2$?\\
    Vertical Distance:
    \[D = |y_{parabola} - y_{line}| = |x^2-x-2|\]
    \[D = |x^2-x-2|\]
    \[D' = |2x-1| = 0\]
    \[x = \frac{1}{2}\]
    Hence, the maximum vertical distance is:
    \[D = |\frac{1}{2}^2 - \frac{1}{2} - 2| =  \frac{9}{4}\]
    \setcounter{enumi}{8}
    \item A model used for the yield $Y$ of an agricultural crop as a function of the nitrogen level $N$ in the soil (measured in appropriate units) is
    \[Y = \frac{kN}{1+N^2}\]
    where $k$ is a positive constant. What nitrogen level gives the best yield?
    \[Y' = \frac{(kN)'(1+N^2) - (1+N^2)'(kN)}{(1+N^2)^2}\]
    \[Y' = \frac{k(1+N^2) - 2N(kN)}{(1+N^2)^2}\]
    \[Y' = \frac{k+kN^2 - 2kN^2}{(1+N^2)^2}\]
    \[Y' = \frac{k -kN^2}{(1+N^2)^2} = 0\]
    \[k-kN^2 = 0\]
    \[kN^2 = k\]
    \[N^2 = 1\]
    \[N = \pm 1\]
    Nitrogen level cannot go below 0.\\
    Hence, $N = 1$ is the best nitrogen level for the best yield.
    \setcounter{enumi}{12}
    \item A farmer wants to fence in an area of 1.5 million square feet in a rectangular field and then divide it in half with a fence parallel to one of the sides of the rectangle. How can he do this so as to minimize the cost of the fence?\\
