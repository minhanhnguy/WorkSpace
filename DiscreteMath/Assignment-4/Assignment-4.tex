Section 2.1:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider the following undirected graph.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{img/img-0.png}
  \end{center}
  
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item How many edges are there in this graph?
          \begin{center}
            There are 9 edges in this graph.
          \end{center}
          
        
          \item Give the degree of each vertex.\\
          The dergree of each vertex is:
          \begin{center}
            a has degree 4\\
            b has degree 4\\
            c has degree 2\\
            d has degree 4\\
            e has degree 4\\
          \end{center}

          \item Do these numbers agree with Euler’s first observation? \\
          The sum of the degrees is 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 18. \\
          There are 9 edges in the graph. \\
          The sum of the degrees is doubled the number of edges.\\
          Hence, these numbers agree with Euler's first observation.
        \end{enumerate}

  \item Consider the following directed graph.
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics{img/img-1.png}
        \end{center}
        \begin{enumerate}
        \newpage
          \item Give the indegree of each vertex.\\
            \begin{center}
              The indegree of a is 1.\\
              The indegree of b is 1.\\
              The indegree of c is 1.\\
              The indegree of d is 2.\\
              The indegree of e is 2.
            \end{center}

          \item Give the outdegree of each vertex.\\
            \begin{center}
              The outdegree of a is 1.\\
              The outdegree of b is 3.\\
              The outdegree of c is 1.\\
              The outdegree of d is 1.\\
              The outdegree of e is 1.
            \end{center}

            \item Compute the sum of the indegrees and the sum of the outdegrees. What do you notice?\\
            The sum of the indegrees is:
            \[1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7\]
            The sum of the outdegrees is:
            \[1+3+1+1+1 = 7\]
            I noticed that the sum of the indegrees is equal to the sum of outdegrees and also equal to the numbers of edges.
            
        \end{enumerate}

  \item A circuit is \textit{simple} if it has no repeated edges. Draw a connected, undirected graph with seven vertices and no simple circuits. How many edges does it have?

  \item Two sets are called disjoint if they have no elements in common, i.e., if their intersection is the empty set. Prove that finite sets A and B are disjoint if and only if $|A| + |B| = |A \cup B|$. Use the definition of $\phi$ and the inclusion–exclusion principle (Equation 2.2.3) in your proof.
    \[|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|\]
    \[\text{Because the intersection of A and B is an empty set.}\]
    \[|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |\phi|\]
    \[|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - 0\]
    \[|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|\]
  \item In a class of 40 students, everyone has either a pierced nose or a pierced ear. The professor asks everyone with a pierced nose to raise their hands. Nine hands go up. Then the professor asked everyone with a pierced ear to do likewise. This time there are 34 hands raised. How many students have piercings both on their ears and their noses?\\~\\
  The number of student have piercings both on their ears and noses is:
  \[34 + 9 - 40 = 3\]
  \item How many integers in the set $\{n \in Z | 1 \leq n \leq 700\}$ are divisible by 2 or 7?\\~\\
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 2 is:
    \[\lfloor\frac{700}{2}\rfloor = 350\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 7 is:
    \[\lfloor\frac{700}{7}\rfloor = 100\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by both 2 and 7 is:
    \[\lfloor\frac{700}{14}\rfloor = 50\]
  Hence, the number of integers in the set divisible by both 2 or 7 is:
    \[350 + 100 - 50 = 400\]

  \item Let A, B, and C be sets, and let $X = A \cup B$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Write $|X \cap C|$ in terms of $|A \cap C|$, $|B \cap C|$, and $|A \cap B \cap C|$. 
    \[|X \cap C| = |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - |A \cap B \cap C|\]
    \item Write $|A \cup B \cup C|$ in terms of A, B, C, $|A \cap B|$, $|A \cap C|$, $|B \cap C|$, and $|A \cap B \cap C|$. (The result is the inclusion–exclusion principle for three sets.)
    \[|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|\]
  \end{enumerate}
  \item How many integers in the set $\{n \in Z | 1 \leq n \leq 700\}$ are divisible by 2, 5, or 7?
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 2 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{2} \rfloor = 350\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 5 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{5} \rfloor = 140\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 7 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{7} \rfloor = 100\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 2 and 5 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{10} \rfloor = 70\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 2 and 7 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{14} \rfloor = 50\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 5 and 7 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{35} \rfloor = 20\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 2, 5 and 7 is:
    \[\lfloor \frac{700}{70} \rfloor = 10\]
  The number of integers in the set are divisible by 2, 5 or 7 is:
    \[350 + 140 + 100 - 70 - 50 - 20 + 10 = 460\]
